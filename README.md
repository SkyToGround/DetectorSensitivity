This code is used to calculate detector sensitivity to point sources for a moving source or detector. The project is very much a work in progress and very little help will be offered to anyone interested in its current shape.

The code is provided undera MIT License. Details can be found in the "LICENSE"-file. The short version is that any use of the code has to provide an attribution back to me.

Some libraries are needed to compile the code:
-Boost
-GSL
-Eigen3
-Python2.7 with matplotlib and numpy
